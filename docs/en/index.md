## Overview 
KaPU is an data-driven mobile application that supports smallholder poultry farmers, and extension officers. 

Smallscale chicken farmers in Tanzania are challenged with:

  * Low chicken productivity from diseases
  * Limited access to agricultural extension services
  * Inadequate biosecurity measures

At farm level in Tanzania, farmers can diagnose chicken diseases and improve their business performance using the KaPU application.
